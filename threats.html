            <p>
                Sea otters have faced significant threats throughout history, particularly from the fur trade, which nearly drove them to extinction.
                Although their populations have rebounded in some areas due to conservation efforts, they remain vulnerable to modern challenges.
                Oil spills are especially devastating, as the oil damages their furâ€™s insulating properties, leading to hypothermia.
                Entanglement in fishing gear, habitat destruction, and climate change also pose risks.
                Continued conservation efforts, habitat protection, and pollution prevention are essential to safeguarding these vital marine mammals.
